# About


I created this fork to remove the time limitations, so that player agents could be debugged locally. [See the original repo here.](https://github.com/CodinGame/SpringChallenge2022)

It is in early experimentational state.


This engine is meant to be imported with maven from a project such as [the Game Engine skeleton](https://github.com/CodinGame/game-skeleton).

# Getting started

Check the documentation on the [tech.io playground](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775).
